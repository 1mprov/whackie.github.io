# whackie
A simple whack-a-mole type game prototype created with Canvas. The game can be played on its Github pages URL https://citrusmatcha.github.io/whackie 

This was built whilst following along the "Creating and Drawing on an HTML5 Canvas using JavaScript" tutorial (https://codeburst.io/creating-and-drawing-on-an-html5-canvas-using-javascript-93da75f001c1). Source on the grid generation was reused as featured in the tutorial.
